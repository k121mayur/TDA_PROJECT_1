### 1. Data Scrapping : I used python and normal requests library to scrap data. Followed GitHub API documentation; Scrapping can't be paused or overwrite if restarted. 

### 2. Suprising facts: Suprisingly I found that the JavaScript is most famous even after 2020 also there are more people from University of Chicago than other company. Vim Script has more average starts that was a shock.

### 3. Actionable recommendation: Developers should share their email addresss also need to avoid longer bio and more number of repos to get more followers.
